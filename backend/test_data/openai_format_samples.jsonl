(we're small contractor, net 30 helpful)\n- Building inspector will need mill certs - included?\n\nJob needs to close escrow by end of month so timing is important.\n\nThanks,\nCarlos Rodriguez\nRodriguez Construction LLC\nLicensed Contractor #789456\nMarin County, CA\ncarlos.r.construction@gmail.com", "customer_name": "Rodriguez Construction LLC", "expected_erp_json": {"customer_info": {"name": "Rodriguez Construction LLC", "contact": "Carlos Rodriguez", "email": "carlos.r.construction@gmail.com", "license": "Licensed Contractor #789456", "location": "Marin County, CA", "business_size": "small residential contractor", "industry": "general_manufacturing", "tier": "small_business"}, "order_details": {"project": "high-end custom home", "application": "exposed structural steel in living room", "delivery_location": "residential area job site", "escrow_deadline": "end of month", "payment_terms_requested": "net 30", "inspector_requirements": "mill certs needed"}, "line_items": [{"item_id": 1, "material": "Steel I-beams", "type": "wide flange", "size": "W8 x 31", "depth": "8 inches", "specifications": [{"length": "20 feet", "quantity": 4, "unit": "beams"}, {"length": "16 feet", "quantity": 2, "unit": "beams"}], "finish_options": [{"option": "painted black", "price_comparison_requested": true}, {"option": "raw steel", "customer_painting": true}], "certifications_required": ["mill_certs"], "application": "exposed structural steel"}], "special_requirements": ["residential_delivery", "small_contractor_payment_terms", "building_inspector_compliance", "architectural_exposed_application"]}, "emergency_indicators": ["escrow deadline end of month"], "industry": "general_manufacturing", "metadata": {"timestamp": "2024-12-01T14:15:00Z", "priority": "NORMAL", "source": "email"}}}
