Subject: Material Requirements for Automotive Assembly Line - Mixed Units
Date: Mon, 12 Feb 2024 13:45:28 -0500

Hello,

We're designing a new automotive assembly line that will operate in both our Canadian and US facilities, so we're dealing with a mix of metric and imperial specifications. Our engineers are based in Montreal but our manufacturing partner is in Detroit, which is causing some interesting unit conversion challenges!

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**
Automotive transmission housing components
Production volume: 10,000 units per year
Quality standard: TS 16949 automotive grade

**MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Main Housing Material**
   - Aluminum 6061-T6 plate
   - Thickness: 25.4mm (exactly 1.000")
   - Dimensions: 600mm x 400mm (approximately 23.6" x 15.7")
   - Quantity: 50 pieces
   - Flatness tolerance: 0.5mm over entire surface
   - Surface finish: 1.6 μm Ra maximum

2. **Reinforcement Brackets**
   - Steel grade: AISI 1018 cold rolled
   - Thickness: 0.250" (6.35mm)
   - Width: 4 inches (101.6mm exactly)
   - Length: 300mm (11.811 inches)
   - Quantity: 200 pieces
   - Edge condition: Mill edge acceptable

3. **Precision Shafts**
   - Material: 4140 steel, heat treated
   - Diameter: 50mm +0.000/-0.025 (approximately 1.9685")
   - Length: 18 inches ±0.5" (457.2mm ±12.7mm)
   - Quantity: 25 pieces
   - Hardness: 30-35 HRC
   - Straightness: 0.05mm TIR over full length

4. **Bushings**
   - Bronze C932 (SAE 660)
   - Outside diameter: 2.125" (53.975mm)
   - Inside diameter: 1.750" +0.0005"/-0.0000" (44.45mm +0.013/-0.000)
   - Length: 75mm (2.953")
   - Quantity: 100 pieces
   - Surface finish: 32 μin Ra on ID

**SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:**

All materials must be supplied with dual-unit documentation (both metric and imperial dimensions on certificates).

The aluminum plates need to be cut to metric dimensions (600 x 400mm) but thickness must be exactly 1.000" imperial - this is critical for compatibility with existing tooling.

Heat treatment for the 4140 shafts should result in 32 HRC ±2, with hardness testing done every 6 inches along the length.

**DELIVERY LOGISTICS:**
- 60% of materials to ship to: 
  Canadian Manufacturing Ltd
  1250 Industrial Blvd
  Montreal, QC H3C 2T5, Canada
  
- 40% of materials to ship to:
  Detroit Assembly LLC  
  5500 Manufacturing Dr
  Detroit, MI 48201, USA

**QUALITY DOCUMENTATION:**
- All material certs to show dimensions in both mm and inches
- Test reports must reference both ASTM and ISO standards where applicable
- Hardness testing in both HRC and HV scales
- Surface roughness in both Ra μm and μin

**PRICING REQUEST:**
Please quote in both USD and CAD (current exchange rate approximately 1 USD = 1.35 CAD).

**QUESTIONS:**
1. Can you supply the aluminum with metric cut dimensions but imperial thickness?
2. Do your material certs automatically show dual units or is this a special request?
3. What's your tolerance capability on the 50mm diameter shafts in metric units?
4. Can you ship directly to both Canadian and US locations from the same order?

**ENGINEERING NOTES:**
Our design engineer (Pierre Dubois) mentions that the shaft diameter is critical - it was originally designed as 2.000" but was changed to 50mm for metric compatibility. However, 50mm = 1.9685", not 2.000". This 0.0315" difference is intentional and required for proper bearing fits in the metric housing.

The bushing ID tolerance of +0.0005"/-0.0000" is unusual but required for press-fit assembly. In metric, this would be +0.013/-0.000mm.

**TIMELINE:**
We need quotes by Friday Feb 16th
Material delivery required by April 1st for production startup
First production run starts April 15th

Thanks for your assistance with this mixed-unit project. It's challenging but the automotive industry is moving toward global standardization.
