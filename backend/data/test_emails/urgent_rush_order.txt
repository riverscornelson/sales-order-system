**BACKUP PLAN:**
If you don't have exactly what we need, please let us know what you DO have in similar sizes/grades. We might be able to modify our repair approach if we know what's available.

We've called our other suppliers but everyone is either closed or doesn't have emergency stock. You guys are our last hope to get this line running before Monday.

Please confirm receipt of this email and let me know what you can do. Time is absolutely critical here.
