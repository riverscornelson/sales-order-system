# 🚀 Agentic Search Implementation Plan
*Multi-Modal MCP-Based Parts Search System*

## 📋 Overview
Transform the rigid search system into an intelligent, autonomous agent-based search architecture using MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools. This will give agents flexibility to explore the parts database creatively and adapt their search strategies for complex scenarios.

## 🎯 Goals
- [ ] Replace rigid search patterns with autonomous agent decision-making
- [ ] Implement multi-modal search capabilities (semantic, fuzzy, dimensional, material-based)
- [ ] Add database exploration and intelligence tools
- [ ] Enable search learning and adaptation
- [ ] Fix the current 0-results search issue
- [ ] Provide agents with true autonomy in parts discovery

## 📊 Current State Analysis
- ✅ **Issue Identified**: All line item searches return 0 results despite catalog containing relevant parts
- ✅ **Root Cause**: Rigid search patterns fail to find 4140 steel rectangular bar for 4140 steel round bar request
- ✅ **Catalog Status**: Successfully loaded with embeddings, contains target parts
- ❌ **Search Flexibility**: Agents cannot adapt search strategies or explore alternatives

## 🛠 Technical Implementation Details

### MCP Server Architecture
```python
# File: app/mcp/search_server.py
class AgenticSearchMCPServer:
    """MCP server providing intelligent search tools"""
    
    tools = [
        "semantic_vector_search",
        "fuzzy_text_search", 
        "material_category_search",
        "dimensional_search",
        "alternative_materials_search",
        "catalog_exploration",
        "analyze_catalog_coverage",
        "find_closest_matches",
        "debug_search_pipeline"
    ]
```

### Agentic Search Coordinator
```python
# File: app/agents/agentic_search_coordinator.py
class AgenticSearchCoordinator:
    """AI-powered search orchestrator with tool autonomy"""
    
    async def search_for_line_item(self, line_item: LineItem) -> SearchResults:
        # Let LLM decide search strategy autonomously
        # Use MCP tools to execute chosen strategies
        # Iterate and adapt based on results
```

### Integration Points
- [ ] **Supervisor Agent**: Update to use AgenticSearchCoordinator
- [ ] **WebSocket Updates**: Enhanced progress reporting for multi-strategy search
