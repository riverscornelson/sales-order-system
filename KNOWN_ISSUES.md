# 🐛 Known Issues

## Issue #1: WebSocket Connection Timing Problem

### 📋 **Summary**
WebSocket connections fail with error `WebSocket is closed before the connection is established` preventing real-time updates in the frontend.

### 🔍 **Details**
- **Error**: `WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8000/ws/client-{id}' failed: WebSocket is closed before the connection is established`
- **Impact**: Users cannot see real-time agent processing updates
- **Scope**: UI/UX issue only - core agent functionality works perfectly
- **Status**: Non-critical - all core improvements are functional

### ✅ **What's Working**
- File upload and processing: ✅
- Agent workflow execution: ✅  
- Database operations: ✅
- Security improvements: ✅
- Architecture refactoring: ✅
- Performance optimizations: ✅

### ❌ **What's Not Working**
- Real-time WebSocket updates in frontend
- Progress cards during agent processing
- Live connection status indicators

### 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
Likely causes:
1. **Race Condition**: Frontend attempts WebSocket connection before backend endpoint is ready
2. **Connection Timing**: Too rapid connection attempt after file upload
3. **CORS/Headers**: Possible WebSocket-specific CORS issue
4. **Browser Security**: Browser may be blocking WebSocket on localhost

### 🛠️ **Reproduction Steps**
1. Start backend: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
2. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Upload any file in browser
4. Check browser console for WebSocket error
5. Observe: Upload works, but no real-time updates

### 💡 **Proposed Solutions**
1. **Add Connection Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for WebSocket connections
2. **Connection Delay**: Add small delay before attempting WebSocket connection
3. **Fallback to Polling**: Use HTTP polling as fallback when WebSocket fails
4. **Connection Health Check**: Pre-verify WebSocket endpoint before connection
5. **CORS Enhancement**: Review WebSocket-specific CORS settings

### 🎯 **Priority**
- **Low-Medium**: Core functionality works, this is a UX enhancement
- **User Impact**: Medium - users can still use system but without real-time feedback
- **Technical Debt**: Low - doesn't affect core architecture or security

### 📝 **Workaround**
Users can:
1. Upload files successfully (agents process in background)
2. Use "Fetch Results" button to get processing results
3. Check backend logs to verify agent processing
4. Use API endpoints directly for testing

### 🔧 **Investigation Notes**
- Backend WebSocket endpoint exists and is properly configured
- Upload and agent processing works correctly
- Issue is isolated to frontend WebSocket connection establishment
- All major refactoring improvements are unaffected
