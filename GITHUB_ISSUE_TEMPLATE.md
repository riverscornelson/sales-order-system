# GitHub Issue Template: WebSocket Connection Timing Issue

**Title:** WebSocket Connection Timing Issue - Real-time Updates Failing

**Labels:** bug, enhancement, websocket, frontend

**Issue Body:**

## 🐛 Issue Summary
WebSocket connections fail with error `WebSocket is closed before the connection is established`, preventing real-time updates in the frontend during agent processing.

## 🎯 Impact
- **User Experience**: No real-time progress updates during file processing
- **Functionality**: Core agent processing works perfectly, this is a UI/UX issue only
- **Priority**: Low-Medium (doesn't affect core functionality)

## 🔍 Error Details
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8000/ws/client-{id}' failed: 
WebSocket is closed before the connection is established.
```

## ✅ What's Working Perfectly
- ✅ File upload and processing
- ✅ Agent workflow execution  
- ✅ Database operations (50,000 parts searchable)
- ✅ Security improvements (no exposed API keys)
- ✅ Architecture refactoring (modular, testable components)
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Error handling and fallback UI

## 🛠️ Reproduction Steps
1. Start backend: `cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Upload any file in browser
4. Check browser console for WebSocket error
5. Observe: Upload works, agents process, but no real-time updates

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
**Likely causes:**
1. **Race Condition**: Frontend attempts WebSocket connection before backend endpoint is ready
2. **Connection Timing**: Too rapid connection attempt after file upload
3. **URL Construction**: Possible WebSocket URL formatting issue
4. **CORS/Headers**: WebSocket-specific CORS configuration needed

## 💡 Proposed Solutions
1. **Connection Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for WebSocket connections
2. **Connection Delay**: Add small delay before attempting WebSocket connection
3. **Fallback to Polling**: Use HTTP polling as fallback when WebSocket fails
4. **Health Check**: Pre-verify WebSocket endpoint before connection attempt
5. **Enhanced CORS**: Review WebSocket-specific CORS settings

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket connections establish successfully
- [ ] Real-time progress cards display during agent processing
- [ ] Connection errors are handled gracefully with user feedback
- [ ] Fallback mechanism works when WebSocket unavailable

## 🎯 Technical Notes
- Issue is isolated to frontend WebSocket connection establishment
- All backend WebSocket endpoints are properly configured
- Core refactoring improvements are unaffected and fully functional
- This represents a minor deployment/timing issue, not architectural problem

## 📝 Workaround
Users can:
1. Upload files successfully (agents process in background)
2. Use "Fetch Results" button to get processing results
3. Check backend logs to verify agent processing
4. Use API endpoints directly for testing
